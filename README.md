# BloodServe
<p align="justify">The blood donation management system is a web-based application developed using Java Spring Boot and MySql. It provides a platform for efficient management of blood donors and their registrations. The system allows donors to register themselves, providing necessary information such as name, contact details, and blood group. CRUD operations are implemented to enable easy management of donor records, including the ability to add, update, and delete donor information.One of the key features of the system is the ability to filter donors based on their blood group. This allows hospitals, blood banks, and other organizations to quickly find suitable donors in case of emergencies or regular blood requirements. The system ensures the privacy and security of donor information, with access restricted to authorized personnel only.</p>
